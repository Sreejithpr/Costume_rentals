## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher

- Maven 3.6+
- Angular CLI 17+

### Backend Setup

1. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install dependencies and run the application:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

3. The backend server will start on `http://localhost:8080`

4. API documentation will be available at `http://localhost:8080/api`

### Frontend Setup

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```

4. The frontend application will be available at `http://localhost:4200`

### Database

The SQLite database will be automatically created as `costume_rental.db` in the backend directory when you first run the application.

## 📊 Database Schema

### Tables
- **customers**: Customer information (name, email, phone, address)
- **costumes**: Costume inventory (name, category, size, daily price, availability)
- **rentals**: Rental records (customer, costume, dates, status)
- **bills**: Billing information (amounts, fees, payment status)

### Key Relationships
- One customer can have many rentals
- One costume can have many rentals (over time)
- Each rental has one bill
- Bills track payment status and additional fees
